About this plugin:

- Party All is a plugin made for streamers by streamers. Although there’s no integration between streaming services and this plugin it provides great interaction for the community in game. This plugin provides streamers the ability to do key all’s & loot drops labeled as a party. The plugin provides the ability to use DecentHolograms & Ajlb for decoration around the party claim. Party claims are unprotected but can be placed within admin claims using world guard. The config.yml file is completely adjustable to the user’s needs. 

Features of PartyAll:
	
- Party All has the ability to drop items to specific players or all players regardless if they’re in the party claim. Every item is customizable via in game gui with the command /party edit {partyname} 

The config.yml offers the ability to blacklist any item in game with the format of their item id. Config.yml offers the following customization options. Decent holograms, by using decent holograms you’re able to display information about the party like total number of attending players, the most money rewarded & a top list of players who have attended the most parties. Your also able to change the type of economy (Support will only be offered if your using vault). There are 3 different types of parties you can choose from in the config, you can only change the type of party from the config file. The first party being the most commonly used is IPP (In Person Party) IPP requires players to be in the party claim to receive rewards. Second is LOR (Login Only Requirement) LOR allows the player to only be logged in to the server to receive drops, regardless of where the player is located they’ll receive the drops. Third is, OPR (Offline Player Receives Drops) This option is buggy right now. (Ver-1.2)
